# 20 Newsgroup Dataset
The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. To the best of my knowledge, it was originally collected by Ken Lang, probably for his Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews paper, though he does not explicitly mention this collection. The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.

# Multinomial Naive Bayes
Performed Test Classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes(already implemented in sklearn).
Implemented Naive Bayes on my own from scratch for text classification. 
Compared results of my implementation of Naive Bayes with one in Sklearn.

# Result
My implementation of multinomial naive bayes:

TRAIN SCORE : 73.86%

TEST SCORE :  58.13%

SKLEARN's implementation of multinomial naive bayes:

TRAIN SCORE :  84.52%

TEST SCORE :  71.37%
